# pomodoro-clock
This is a Chrome Extension that adds a Pomodoro Clock to the Extensions Bar in the top right of the browser.

This extension features:

- Default Interval length of 25 minutes.
- Default Break length of 5 minutes.
- Both Interval and Break can be adjusted prior to starting the clock or by pausing the timer.
- When it changes state from the Interval to Break or vice versa, a chime plays to alert the user.
